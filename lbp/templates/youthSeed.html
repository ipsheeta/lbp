 			<h2>About Us</h2>
 			<p class="lead">
				<strong>Youth SEED</strong>(Youth Social Entrepreneurship for Equitable Development) was built on a foundation of 3 years of social entrepreneurship training for Bay Area youth, in which 25 youth led social enterprises were funded and launched.  Originally known as Ashoka's Youth Venture San Francisco Bay Area, Youth SEED was created to advance our unique model of using youth social entrepreneurship as a vehicle for equitable development and to fully utilize our position in one of the most thriving social entrepreneurship ecosystems in the world. With the support of Youth Venture and Ashoka, we have now transitioned to fiscal sponsorship with Community Initiatives in San Francisco, and we are ready to continue supporting the next generation of social entrepreneurs in the Bay Area.<br>
			</p>
			<p>
				<h3>Our Vision</h3> Bay Area youth will have the self determination and the resources to play a pivotal role in building a more economically just and socially responsible global community.<br>
				<h3>Our Mission:</h3>To support community led social enterprises by providing training, resources and investment to young innovators who traditionally face barriers to economic opportunities</p>
